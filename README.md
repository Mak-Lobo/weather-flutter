# weather

A new Flutter project.
-  The project is among the various projects undertaken by me to learn Flutter.
-  The final application show progress with learning Flutter although it does not perform the required function well.

-  There is an error in the merging of branches due to a mistake made. The working code is in the 'master' branch.
-  Please note that this is for personal learning experience only. You may run the app but it is not a guarantee it will be beneficial.
